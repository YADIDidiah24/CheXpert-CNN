## 1. Prepare Your Folder

1. **Create a project folder:**  
   Begin by creating a new folder to store your files and credentials.

2. **Add Kaggle API credentials:**

   - Scroll down to the **API** section and click on **Create New API Token**.
   - This will download a `kaggle.json` file containing your API key.

3. **Move `kaggle.json` to the project folder:**  
   Place the `kaggle.json` file directly in the project folder you created.

## 2. Run the Code
